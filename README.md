# DOG PARTY
A site about some dogs by a beginning programmer. 

### Purpose 
Dog party was built from a comp for our first assignment for the Front-End engineering program at Turing School of Software and Design. Below is an image of the assigned comp, and an image of my page.  The site is completed without JavaScript and media queries extensions.
